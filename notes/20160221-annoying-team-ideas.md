Ninjask (Baton Pass)

Bold Nature (+Def, -Atk)

While it's not the force it used to be in the OU metagame, proper precautions still need to be taken when you're up against one of these things. Like Whimsicott, Ninjask's ability is what really makes it annoying to face. First of all, Ninjask is the second fastest Pokémon in the entire game. With his ability Speed Boost boosting his Speed by +1 at the end of each turn, Ninjask can become even faster, letting it get up a quick Substitute easier. With the combination of Substitute and Protect, it is quite easy for Ninjask to accumulate several Speed boosts if your opponent doesn't carry any priority attacks, and then Baton Pass it to a Pokémon who needs it. After Ninjask has done his thing you would not want to laugh at a Rampardos ever again, as Ninjask can turn slow, mediocre Pokémon into threatening killing machines that can plow through teams with relative ease. The last slot is up to your preferences. Swords Dance is nice so when you Baton Pass the recipient is even more threatening; however, it is a little bit greedy and can be hard to pull off if Ninjask has not got a Substitute up. Toxic can also be used perhaps to cripple something that is setting up on Ninjask, or to annoy a wall that is about to phaze Ninjask out.


How to beat:

You need to taunt ninjask to stop setting up. If you have anyone with aqua jet/mach punch you can kill his rampardos before he can attack... Focus sash infernape is a viable option. I would say taunt ninjask, because that will essentially force a switch. Set up stealth rock with aerodactyl after taunting azelf. This will mean ninjask will be 2hko'd by stealth rock (if not, mach punch will kill it.) In summary, lead with aerodactyl, taunt then stealth rock, then when he throws out ninjask, taunt with infernape then mach punch him. Hope this helps!
